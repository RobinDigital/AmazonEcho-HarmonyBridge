# AmazonEcho-HarmonyBridge
Amazon Echo to Logitech Harmony Bridge

C# code that emulates an Hue Bridge, connects to Harmony Hub, enables Amazon Echo to find and use Harmony activities
Runs on Windows and Linux (tested using Mono on a Synology NAS)

On first run, it will create a settings.xml file, you'll have to fill in the Logitech Harmony credentials and the IP of the server/pc you're running on which you want to use.

It should be easily extended, but will need some serious clean-up :)

Used code/examples from all over the Internet, mostly refered to in comments, some of them:

And added my own stuff.
